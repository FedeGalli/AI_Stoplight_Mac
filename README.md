# Stoplight Reinforcement-Learning Optimizer

This Unity Project has the idea to test how to optimeze the wait-time of cars waiting at Stoplights intersections. <br />

To do so, i recreated using Unity the traffic flow logic of single cars arriving at an intersection. While, by using a Reinforcement learning algorith applied to all the stoplights, i
managed the stoplights timings based on the traffic arrival at each road.<br />
